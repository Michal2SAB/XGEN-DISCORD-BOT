# XGEN-DISCORD-BOT
A discord bot for XGenStudios. Mostly for stick arena. Just thought I'd release the rewritten and easy to use version for those who still play sa and shit and wanna run the bot in their server, cause I don't care about these games anymore.

# REQUIREMENTS

1. You need python 3.6 or newer installed on your computer.
2. After you have installed python, download this respository as .zip file.
3. After you downloaded and unpacked the folder, go to the folder "Install". 
4. Then run the file 'install.bat'. It will install all the required modules for this project for you.
5. If you see any errors, you might need to also download and install this: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/files/latest/download

# HOW TO RUN THIS BOT
1. After you done the stuff above, you can go back and get to editing the config.ini file. You can open it with notepad or any other editor.
2. In config.ini you have bunch of variables that you need to edit. Bot token, your sa bot accs, your admin name.. etc. You will get it once you open it. Note that your sa bot accs needs to be all ending with a number, excluding the first one. So for example account, account1, account2 and so on. Your bot password is a password for all of these accounts.
3. After you set all the variables, you can just run the 'run.py' file and your bot will start in the server you invited it to.
4. If you don't know how to get a discord bot token or how to invite it to your server, just google it, there are tons of tutorials for that.
5. And that's all. Have fun I guess. The bot is pretty much yours (kinda).
6. Also, don't edit any of the .py files unless you know what you're doing.
